# ‚ö° Transformer Life Expectancy Prediction

This project predicts the remaining useful life (RUL) of power transformers using a combination of machine learning techniques and domain-specific health index formulas. The system monitors key electrical and thermal parameters to compute a Transformer Health Index and forecasts potential failure or maintenance needs. This work supports predictive maintenance, operational efficiency, and cost savings in the energy sector.

Transformers are critical to power grids and their failure can result in major disruptions. This project models the aging and health of transformers by:

- Using real and simulated condition-monitoring data
- Calculating a Transformer Health Index based on weighted parameters (temperature, current, oil condition)
- Training regression models to predict remaining life
- Generating synthetic datasets when real data is limited

Health Index Formula:
> Health Index = (0.2 √ó TR) + (0.2 √ó TY) + (0.2 √ó TB) + (0.15 √ó IR) + (0.15 √ó IY) + (0.1 √ó IB) + (0.1 √ó TO)  
Where each parameter is normalized and weighted based on operational importance.
